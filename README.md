Phone Zone - Mobile Phone shop

The first website I designed during my (non web design focused) degree. Developed April - May 2012

This was my first encounter with PHP, HTML and CSS with a bit of JS

It lacks proper validation and the checkout function is not entirely ncomplete. It is less efficient when compared to the SMS project. 

I will have a working link to the site on Monday as I have a few things to do before then:

I am having to correct some bugs resulting from moving to a new server as well as rebuilding the lost database.
